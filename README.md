# bluesky_playground

Initially just a use of the atproto SDK to post a Bluesky message using an account whose credentials are hidden in a .env file.
Eventually, I might make something of this.
Ideas include: a Git Action for a repo.  
A quote a day post generator.
Hook up AI to make weird sentences and post them?

## Important disclaimer

If any

## Getting Started

This repository contains Python utilities for interacting with the Bluesky platform using the atproto SDK. With these scripts, you can quickly experiment with posting, fetching, and managing content on Bluesky through programmatic access.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A Bluesky account and any required app passwords or API credentials

---

## Installing

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErikPohl444/bsky_playground.git
cd bsky_playground
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the required packages directly:

```bash
pip install atproto
```

## Running the tests

I will explain how to test the system here using the automated tests.
